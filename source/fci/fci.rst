Description
===========
This section discusses three of the closely related configuration interaction (CI) methods available in BAGEL; non-relativistic full CI (FCI), non-relativistic restricted CI (RASCI), and 4-component relativistic CI.  These methods have many similarities, but substantial difference in their use, and so each shall be discussed in a different subsection. Note that keywords which work for one method may not work in another.

Most of the relevant code for these methods can be found in $BAGEL/src/ci/ci (FCI) ,   
$BAGEL/src/ci/ras (ras) 
$BAGEL/src/ci/zfci (ZFCI) 

FCI is aims to describe the wavefunction as a linear combination of Slater determinants:

.. math::
  \Psi = \sum^{N}_{i}c_{i}\Phi_{N}

This technique is good for describing systems featuring substantial dynamic correlation.  the algorithm by which the coefficients are determined can all be specified. 


==================
FCI Pre-requisites
==================
A reference wavefunciton generated by some kind of Hartree-Fock, DFT, CASSCF, RASSCF, or CI-type calculation.

ZFCI Keywords
============


.. topic:: ``frozen``

   | DESCRIPTION: to have frozen orbitals or not.
   | DEFAULT: true
   | DATATYPE: bool

.. topic:: ``algorithm``
   
   | DESCRIPTION: Algorithm to be used in the determinantion of the CI coeffcients.
   | DEFAULT: KH.
   | DATATYPE: string
   | VALUES: 
   |    ``KH, Knowles, Handy``: use Knowles-Handy.
   |    ``HZ, Harrison, Zarrabian``: use Harrison-Zarrabian.
   |    ``Dist, parallel``: use Parallel algorithm.
   | RECOMMENDATION: If the active space is large and you have multiple processors, use Dist. Otherwise, use default.

.. topic:: ``charge``

   | DESCRIPTION: The electronic charge of the system.
   | DEFAULT:  0
   | DATATYPE: integer
   | VALUES: `any int`
   | RECOMMENDATION: The electronic charge of the system. 


.. topic:: ``frozen``

   | DESCRIPTION: Sp.
   | DEFAULT: false.
   | DATATYPE: boolean
   | VALUES:
   |    ``TRUE``: Freeze orbitals..
   |    ``FALSE``: Do not freeze obitals.
   | RECOMMENDATION: Use default; no frozen orbitals. Freezing orbitals can reduce the cost, but also the accuracy of the calculation.

.. topic:: ``maxiter_fci``

   | DESCRIPTION: Maximum number of iterations in FCI algorithm 
   | DEFAULT: 
   | DATATYPE: integer
   | VALUES: ``and integer``
   | RECOMMENDATION: Becareful, a common mistake is to input the value s_z and not the number of electrons.

.. topic:: ``nspin``

   | DESCRIPTION: Number of unpaired electrons. 
   | DEFAULT: 0
   | DATATYPE: integer
   | VALUES: ``and integer``
   | RECOMMENDATION: Becareful, a common mistake is to input the value s_z and not the number of electrons.



.. topic:: ``nstates``

   | DESCRIPTION: Number of states to calculate. 
   | DEFAULT:``must be specified``
   | DATATYPE: integer
   | VALUES: ``any positive double``
   | RECOMMENDATION: User dependent, calculation of multiple states are slower.

.. topic:: ``restart``

   | DESCRIPTION: Restart the calcualtion from an earlier one. 
   | DEFAULT: false
   | DATATYPE: boolean
   | VALUES: ``true, false``
   | RECOMMENDATION: Use if possible.



.. topic:: ``thresh`` or ``thresh_fci``

   | DESCRIPTION: Threshold for convergence of selected CI algorithm 
   | DEFAULT: 1.0e-10 
   | DATATYPE: double
   | VALUES: ``any positive double``
   | RECOMMENDATION: Default, reduce for greater accuracy.



Example
=======
Possibly series of calculations for H2 with stretching bond. HF and CI . The HF energies will not describe the bond breaking correclty.

Sample input
------------

.. code-block:: javascript 

   { "bagel" : [

   {
     "title" : "molecule",
     "basis" : "sto-3g",
     "df_basis" : "svp-jkfit",
     "angstrom" : false,
     "geometry" : [
       { "atom" : "H",  "xyz" : [   -0.000000,     -0.000000,      0.9000]},
       { "atom" : "H",  "xyz" : [   -0.000000,     -0.000000,      0.0]}
     ]
   },

   {
     "title" : "hf",
     "thresh" : 1.0e-10
   },

   {
     "title" : "fci",
     "algorithm" : "parallel",
     "nstate" : 2
   }

   ]}


Some information about the output should also be included. This will not be entire output but enough for the reader to know their calculation worked.

    :figclass: align-center

    This is an example of how to insert a figure.
