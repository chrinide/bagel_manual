Relativistic full configuration interaction (RelFCI)
****************************************************
===========
Description
===========

FCI is aims to describe the wavefunction as a linear combination of Slater determinants:

.. math::
  \Psi = \sum^{N}_{i}c_{i}\Phi_{N}

Relativistic CI differs from non-relativistic CI primarily in the Hamiltonian which is used in the diagonalization. The physical consequence of is that this accounts for spin-orbit coupling, and the associated mixing of different spin-multiplets.

 As the kind of relativstic Hamiltonian used can have a significant impact on the computational cost there are three possible options of increasing accuracy. It is  worth noting that due to the seperarte treatement of all states within the same multiplet substantial degeneracies may occur, and so it is preferable to avoid requesting only some of the states in a multiplet.


==============
Pre-requisites
==============
A reference wavefunciton generated by some kind of Hartree-Fock, DFT, CASSCF, RASSCF, or CI-type calculation.

Keywords
========


.. topic:: ``maxiter (or maxiter_fci)``

   | **Description**: Maximum number of iterations in the FCI algorithm
   | **Default**: 100
   | **Datatype**: integer
   | **Recommendation**:  The default is usually sufficient.  

.. topic:: ``davidson_subspace``

   | **Description**:  Number of vectors retained in the limited-memory Davidson algorithm.
   | **Default**: 20
   | **Datatype**: integer
   | **Recommendation**: Altering this parameter can sometimes change the convergence behavior.  Any number above 3 is reasonable.  

.. topic:: ``thresh (or thresh_fci)``

   | **Description**: Threshold for convergence of selected CI algorithm 
   | **Default**: 1.0e-10 
   | **Datatype**: double
   | **Values**: ``any positive double``
   | **Recommendation**: Use default value

.. topic:: ``print_thresh``

   | **Description**:  Threshold below which CI coefficients are not printed (to casscf.log after each macroiteration, and to the standard output at the end of the calculation)
   | **Default**: 0.05
   | **Datatype**: double

.. topic:: ``state``

   | **Description**: Number of states computed for each spin value.
   | **Default**:  There is no default; this parameter must be supplied in the input.  
   | **Datatype**: vector of integers
   | **Note**:  An array of integers is supplied, where each one indicates the number of states for a given spin value.  For example, 
   |      the input [ 1 ] gives a singlet ground state, while [ 3, 0, 1 ] gives three singlets and one triplet (6 states total).  
   |      Be careful!  While the spin values you specified are used in generating guess CI coefficients, the spin sectors will mix, and the 
   |      algorithm returns the *n* lowest eigenstates regardless of their spin expectation values.  

.. topic:: ``gaunt``

   | **Description**:  Used to specify the form of the 2-electron Hamiltonian used.  The default is to use the Dirac--Coulomb Hamiltonian;
   |     If "gaunt" is set to true, the Gaunt interaction will be added, which accounts for direct spin--spin and spin-other-orbit 
   |     coupling between electrons.  
   | **Default**: Value obtained from reference wavefunction.  
   | **Datatype**: bool
   | **Recommendation**:  Choose based on the importance of relativistic effects for your problem.  

.. topic:: ``breit``

   | **Description**:  Used to determine whether the full Breit interaction (including the gauge term) is included in the two-electron Hamiltonian.  
   | **Default**: Value obtained from reference wavefunction.  
   | **Datatype**: bool
   | **Recommendation**:  Choose based on the importance of relativistic effects for your problem.  

.. topic:: ``frozen``

   | **Description**:  If this is set to true, and "ncore" is not specified, then core molecular orbitals are frozen as doubly occupied in all Slater determinants.  
   | **Default**: false.
   | **Datatype**: boolean
   | **Recommendation**:  Frozen orbitals reduce the computational cost with some tradeoff in accuracy.  Freezing the core is often a good compromise, but this will depend on your particular problem. 

.. topic:: ``ncore``

   | **Description**:  Number of core molecular orbitals to be frozen as doubly occupied in all determinants.  This parameter overrides the default determined by "frozen."
   | **Default**: Either zero or all core orbitals, depending on the "frozen" parameter.  
   | **Datatype**: boolean

.. topic:: ``norb``

   | **Description**: Number of correlated orbitals.  Any high-energy orbitals in excess of this number or left empty.  
   | **Default**:  All molecular orbitals except those excluded using ncore.
   | **Datatype**: int
   | **Recommendation**:  Include all virtual orbitals if you can afford it

.. topic:: ``only_ints``

   | **Description**:  Used to compute integrals, print to a file, and terminate the program.
   |      This can be used to interface BAGEL to an external CASSCF solver.  
   | **Default**: false
   | **Datatype**: boolean
   | **Recommendation**:  Normally use the default value.  

.. topic:: ``spin_adapt``

   | **Description**:  This parameter allows us to deactivate the generation of spin-adapted configuration state functions in the starting guess for the CAS-CI part.  
   | **Default**: true
   | **Datatype**: boolean
   | **Recommendation**:  Normally use the default setting.  If you are computing all or nearly all the states that can be formed with a given 
   |     active space, you will encounter an error stating that "generate_guess produced an invalid determinant."  
   |     Deactivating this feature leads to a poorer guess but eliminates that problem.  

.. topic:: ``charge``

   | **Description**: The electronic charge of the system.
   | **Default**:  0
   | **Datatype**: integer
   | **Values**: `any int`
   | **Recommendation**: The electronic charge of the system. 

.. topic:: ``active``

   | **Description**:  Orbital indices for the spatial MOs that should be included in the active space.  
   | **Default**:  Frontier orbitals are used.  If a DHF reference waveunction (or Hcore guess) is used, the canonical orbitals are ordered by orbital energy, 
   |     the "nclosed" lowest-energy orbitals are set to closed, and the next "nact" are set to active.  If the reference wavefunction was 
   |     generated by CASSCF, the order of orbitals is maintained.  
   | **Datatype**: vector of integers
   | **Recommendation**:  The convergence behavior is often improved by choosing guess orbitals similar in character to your target active orbitals.  
   |     For both relativistic Hartree--Fock and CASSCF, useful tools to identify good starting orbitals include using the "pop" keyword to print 
   |     orbital population analysis and using the "moprint" module to visualize orbital densities using Gaussian cube format.  

.. topic:: ``aniso``

   | Description:  This is the key for a block in the input file which provides parameters for magnetic anisotropy analysis, in determination of g-factors and zero-field splitting parameters.  See below for details.  

.. topic:: ``restart``

   | **Description**: Generate binary archive files that can be used to restart an incomplete calculation.  
   | **Default**: false
   | **Datatype**: boolean
   | **Recommendation**: Use if possible.
