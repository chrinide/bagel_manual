******************************************
Configuration interaction 
******************************************

This section discusses three of the closely related configuration interaction (CI) methods available in BAGEL; non-relativistic :ref:`fci` , :ref:`rasci`, and :ref:`zfci`.  These methods have many similarities, but substantial difference in their use. Accordingly, each shall be discussed in a different subsection. Note that keywords which work for one method may not work in another.

Most of the relevant code for these methods can be found in 
BAGEL/src/ci/ci (FCI) ,   
BAGEL/src/ci/ras (RASCI), 
BAGEL/src/ci/zfci (ZFCI).
